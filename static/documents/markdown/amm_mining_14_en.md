### Rules

1) This round starts at 00:00 UTC September 9, 2021, and lasts for **28 days**.

2) During the event, every seven days as a settlement cycle, a total of 4 cycles.

3) Activities are carried out in the first six days of each settlement cycle, and the settlement ends at 00:00 UTC on the seventh day, and the next cycle starts at 00:00 UTC in the next day.

4) We take random snapshots of the relevant AMM pools several times a day, and calculate the amount of rewards each LP earns based on the average of all snapshot balances in the round.

5) The rewards of each cycle will be directly distributed to LP's layer2 accounts after the seventh day of liquidation, but note that single-cycle rewards below $1 will not be distributed or accumulated.

4) For pools with liquidity mining, providing liquidity is how you mine. You automatically start mining without any other user action.

5) Mining does not involve locking up your funds, but the LP tokens must stay in your Loopring layer2 account. If you withdraw LP tokens to the Ethereum mainnet, you cannot get mining rewards, because it will not be recorded in the snapshots. You can transfer part or all of your LP tokens to other accounts on layer2, but the mining rewards will also follow.

Note: LP tokens are ownership tokens issued by AMM pools to LPs. For example, the LP token of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool is called LP-LRC-ETH. The relative proportion of LP-LRC-ETH represents your actual ownership of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool. If you transfer LP tokens to other accounts, it is equivalent to transferring the corresponding underlying assets in the pool to other accounts.
