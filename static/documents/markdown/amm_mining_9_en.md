## AMM Liquidity Mining (Round #9)


### Rewards


| **Project** | **Pool** | **Reward** |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
EvidenZ | BCDT⇄ETH | 40,000 BCDT |
Reflexer | RAI⇄ETH | 25 FLX |

### Rules

1) This round starts at 00:00 UTC May 27, 2021, and lasts for **13 days**.

2) We take random snapshots of the relevant AMM pools several times a day, and calculate the amount of rewards each LP earns based on the average of all snapshot balances in the round.

3) FLX rewards will distributed by Reflexer on Layer-1 at app.reflexer.finance during their 3rd batch of incentives in mid-June.

4) All other rewards will be directly distributed to LP's layer2 accounts on the day after the campaigns end (Day 14).

5) For pools with liquidity mining, providing liquidity is how you mine. You automatically start mining without any other user action.

6) Mining does not involve locking up your funds, but the LP tokens must stay in your Loopring layer2 account. If you withdraw LP tokens to the Ethereum mainnet, you cannot get mining rewards, because it will not be recorded in the snapshots. You can transfer part or all of your LP tokens to other accounts on layer2, but the mining rewards will also follow.

7) Some of the incentivized pools continue beyond this 13-day round, into multi-month campaigns.

Note: LP tokens are ownership tokens issued by AMM pools to LPs. For example, the LP token of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool is called LP-LRC-ETH. The relative proportion of LP-LRC-ETH represents your actual ownership of the LRC⇄ETH AMM pool. If you transfer LP tokens to other accounts, it is equivalent to transferring the corresponding underlying assets in the pool to other accounts.
